**Game of Life**

A cellular automaton invented by the English mathematician *John Conway* in 1970.\
It is a game without players, in which a person creates an initial state and then only observes its development.\
The game can create processes with *Turing* completeness, which allows any *Turing*  machine to be implemented.
